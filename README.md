Rehike is a custom web frontend server for YouTube.

We use it to accurately restore the old YouTube layout and feel, which is known as Hitchhiker. This version of YouTube existed from 2013 to 2020 and is preferred by us due to its speed and simplicity.

**Rehike is not a browser extension, nor does it intend to function as one.** Rather, it works over the browser, offering more freedom to what it is allowed to do and greater portability. This makes Rehike browser independent and, to an extent, system independent.

## Want an easy-to-install extension instead?

Please check out our friend, Vorapis 2013 / V3. This is a browser extension that restores the old YouTube layout in a very similar manner. You can download V3 at https://vorapis.pages.dev.
