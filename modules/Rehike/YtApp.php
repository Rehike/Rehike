/**
 * Defines the global state for the Rehike application.
 * 
 * This is used as the primary information sent to the templater, and thus
 * contains all information needed to generate a valid YouTube page. It is 
 * also a huge mess.
 * 
 * A bit of history: this is an evolution of a project-long global object
 * named $yt. Before a codebase cleanup over a year after the project started,
 * this object was just an (object)[] (i.e. an stdClass).
 * 
 * As a result, this class is going to be a little messy. Moving to a proper 
 * class still allows us to benefit from type safety and IDE static analysis.
