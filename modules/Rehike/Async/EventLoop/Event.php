 * Events operate based on PHP's native generators. This allows a

 * event can be interrupted and yield control to other concurrently
 * running events. As such, singlethreaded asynchronity is achieved.
 * 
 * By themselves, events don't really serve much of a purpose. State
 * cannot be easily communicated between events or to outside areas.
 * Events only serve as a simple proxy for functions that can be paused
 * and resumed within a loop.
 * 
 * The Promise API exists to extend the functionality of an event. With
 * promises, callbacks can be bound and state can be transported, just
 * like a regular function. This paradigm is very reminiscent of
 * ECMAScript's functionality, except that our event loop is blocking and
 * does not necessarily let synchronous functions continue executing in
 * between events.
