# Classic video player messages. Since these were baked into the binary,
# and we use one modified binary, the messages are loaded dynamically.
#
# Rather than translating these by hand, which is an admittedly tedious process,
# you can use Wayback Machine CDX search to find an archive of the player with
# your specific language code, then copy them here. The classic player binary is
# called "html5player", followed by the language code. Although the source data
# will be a JavaScript object, you can convert it to a translation file simply
# by running it through beautifier.io and then removing all commas after quotes.
#
# The player version that we use is from November 2014, and uses a VFL set, so
# the URL goes: s.ytimg.com/yts/jsbin/html5player-LANGUAGE-vflID/html5player.js
#
# The strings are a little scattered (I think this is because they come from
# multiple different modules which were concatenated together), so there are a
# few different sources from which you'll have to take.
#
# From what I can tell, there are five main sources of string registration:
#    - Main strings (the massive one)
#    - Fresca (live) module
#    - Subtitles (captions) module
#    - 3D module
#    - YTP (paid content) module
#
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# If you don't know how to do that, then you can simply leave it unmodified when
# submitting a translation, and a Rehike maintainer will add them for you.
#
# We are happy to do this work for you!
# !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#
# There are only a few unique strings here that will require manual translation.
# The convention that will be used for this file will use camelCase names for
# custom messages, and CONSTANT_CASE names for official player messages that you
# can get from the JS.

# BEGIN UNIQUE STRINGS

# Looping wasn't supported in this player revision, so we had to add a custom
# implementation. As such, a custom string is also required.
