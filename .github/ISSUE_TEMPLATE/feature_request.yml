        Thanks for requesting a feature in Rehike! However, before you continue, please make sure of all these things.

        1. You are running the latest version of Rehike. You don't want to request a feature that already exists!
        2. This feature has not been requested before.
        3. It doesn't use any shady third-party API. We use Return YouTube Dislike because it used and trusted by many.
        4. It doesn't stray too far from the vanilla Hitchhiker experience.
        5. It isn't a stylistic change that can be done with CSS.
